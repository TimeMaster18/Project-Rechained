5. **Run DepotDownloader Command**:
    - Use the following command to download the specific version:
      ```sh
      ./DepotDownloader.exe -app 427270 -depot 427271 -manifest 808827202674972462 -username YourSteamUsername -password YourSteamPassword
      ```

    ./DepotDownloader.exe DepotDownloader.dll -app 427270 -depot 427271 -manifest 808827202674972462 -username yourusername -password yourpassword
    ```

6. **Enter Steam Guard Code (if needed)**:
    - If Steam Guard is enabled on your account, you may be prompted to enter a code sent to your email or generated by the Steam mobile app.

7. **Wait for the Download to Complete**:
    - DepotDownloader will now connect to Steam and download the specified version.
    - The downloaded files will be saved in a folder named after the App ID (427270) within the DepotDownloader directory.

8. **Verify the Download**:
    - Once the download is complete, navigate to the download folder to ensure all files are there.

10. Extract the downloaded Project_Rechained_Launcher.zip contents inside the root folder of your Siege game installation. (Same folder that contains "Binaries", "Engine", etc)

11. Run the "ProjectRechainedLauncher.exe" inside the ProjectRechained folder. 
    - Siege game installation is independent of Survival (for the time being) and can't be launcher from Steam.

### Additional Tips

- **Privacy**: In case of security concerns, feel free to change your Steam password after completing the download.
- If you want to have both versions (Survival and Siege), don't delete or replace any folders/files and keep both installations.
